# DevApps

DevApps is a simple app created to send a notification to a telegram channel, DevApps, when changes are committed to this repository: [Availebla/DevApps](https://github.com/Availebla/DevApps).

## Getting Started

### Apps Used

* Webhooks integrations: https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks

## How it works

The app utilizes github actions which runs a workflow every time a change is committed onto the main branch. This worflow is documented here: (.github/workflows/CICD.yml). The key line of code performs a POST web request with a JSON payload that is recieved by webhooks with a predefined event trigger and a personal key to connect to the IFTTT applet. The IFTT applet then posts a message to telegram (as shown in the screenshot above) to confirm a change has been made.

### Github Actions Workflow: Essential Code
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"A change has been committed":"Kaboom!"}' https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/commited/json/with/key/${{ secrets.WEBHOOKS_SECRET }}
```
Breaking down the code, there are few important components:
| Code Component | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| '{"A change has been committed":"Kaboom!"}' | This is the JSON Payload which is delivered to our IFTTT applet using the POST command |
| trigger/commited/ | 'commited' is the pre-configured event name used to trigger our IFTTT applet |
| ${{ secrets.WEBHOOKS_SECRET }} | The IFTTT webhooks key is unique to your applet and should this repo be forked, will need to be replaced with your own Secret Key! |

The Unique Secret key can be found by visiting this page after you've created the applet on IFTTT: https://maker.ifttt.com/use
This is then added into the repository settings as a Key-Value pair as shown in the screenshot below
